## üîß Changes Made to Fix App Opening Issue

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging at every step
- Check if app is installed before trying to open
- Verify launch intent exists
- Better exception handling with stack traces

### 2. Added Toast Notifications
Every action now shows a Toast message:
- "Opening [App Name]" - When app launches
- "App not installed" - If app doesn't exist
- "Command: [command]" - Shows recognized command
- Error messages for debugging

### 3. Improved Intent Flags
Added both flags for better reliability:
- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` - Launch in new task
- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` - Clear previous instances

### 4. Added Validation
- Check if app is installed before opening
- Verify intent can be resolved
- Get actual app name for user feedback

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Toast Shows But App Doesn't Open

#### Possible Causes:

1. **App Not Installed**
   - Toast will say "App not installed"
   - Solution: Install the app

2. **Wrong Package Name**
   - Some apps have different package names
   - Example: Some devices use different camera apps
   - Check logcat for actual error

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Some apps might not allow external launching
   - Rare but possible

4. **Device Restrictions**
   - Some manufacturers restrict app launching
   - Check device settings

### Problem: No Toast Shows at All

1. **Voice Not Recognized**
   - Check microphone permission
   - Speak clearly
   - Reduce background noise
   - Check notification says "Voice Commands Active"

2. **Service Not Running**
   - Check if notification is visible
   - Try toggling voice commands off and on
   - Check logcat for service crashes

3. **Handler Issue**
   - Toast uses Handler.post
   - Should work but check logs
