MainActivity (UI)
    ↓ starts
VoiceCommandService (Background)
    ↓ uses
Android SpeechRecognizer
    ↓ triggers
GazeAccessibilityService (System Actions)
```

#### Key Components

1. **Continuous Listening**

   - Handles errors gracefully
   - 1-second delay between restarts

2. **Command Processing**
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Multiple aliases support
   - Natural language variations

3. **App Opening**
   - Predefined app list
   - Dynamic app search
   - Package manager integration

4. **System Actions**
   - Accessibility service integration
   - Global actions (home, back, recents)
   - Screenshot via accessibility API

5. **Notification Management**
   - Persistent notification
   - Stop button
   - Status updates
   - Command feedback

### Permissions Required

| Permission | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| RECORD_AUDIO | Listen for voice commands | Yes |
| FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE | Background listening | Yes |
| QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES | Find installed apps | Yes |
| BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE | System actions & screenshot | For system actions |

### User Flow

1. User opens app
2. Taps "Voice OFF" button
3. Grants microphone permission
4. Service starts, notification appears
5. User speaks commands
6. Commands executed immediately
7. Service continues in background
8. User stops via notification or toggle

### Error Handling

- Microphone permission denial → Show toast, don't start service
- Speech recognition unavailable → Stop service automatically
- No speech detected → Auto-restart listening
- Command not recognized → Log and continue
- App not found → Log error and continue

### Privacy & Security

- All voice processing done locally
- Uses Android's built-in speech recognizer
- No data sent to external servers
- No voice recordings stored
- Permissions clearly explained

### Backward Compatibility

- Works on Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- Screenshot requires Android 9+ (API 28+)
- Graceful degradation for older versions
- Permission checks for all features

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test microphone permission flow
2. Test all predefined app commands
3. Test dynamic app name matching
4. Test system navigation commands
5. Test background operation
6. Test notification stop button
7. Test help dialog
8. Test with/without accessibility service
9. Test in different noise environments
10. Test battery impact

### Future Enhancements (Possible)

- [ ] Volume control commands
- [ ] Music playback control
- [ ] Custom app shortcuts
- [ ] Voice confirmation feedback
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Offline voice model
